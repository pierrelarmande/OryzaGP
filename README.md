## Updating OryzaGP dataset during BLAH7

The aim of this projet is to :

- update the datasets with new pubmed entries
- process annotation on gene/protein entities

### Step one updating OryzaGP with new pubmed entries

- Downloaded Oryza reference dataset from Oryzabase database https://shigen.nig.ac.jp/rice/oryzabase/.
Oryzabase provides manually curated dataset for new rice related pubmed entries 
- A list of pubmedid have been created and uploaded on http://pubannotation.org/projects/OryzaGP_2021
